# dervi8 - A painfully slow Machine Learning Framework

This is painfully slow Python Machine Learning implementation written from scratch for fun. It's not recomended to run
in production (or anywhere for that matter), unless you have a lot of time to kill.

## Features

* 2D Matrix implementation using `list`s of `list`s

## Requirements

* Python 3.8.5 of above (only tested on this)
* Poetry for managing dependencies
